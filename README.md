I'm a Software Engineer from New Delhi, India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. I graduated from Delhi Technological University(Formerly Delhi College of Engineering) in 2018 to join [Grofers](grofers.com) as a Backend Engineer.

My work at Grofers has provided me with decent experience building production-ready systems with Python and Kubernetes at a scale of million daily active users.

During my Bachelor's in Software Engineering, I've been mostly involved with open source projects. I'm a Google Summer of Code'17 scholar and have contributed to complex codebases of LibreOffice, Mozilla(Firefox for Android) and OpenMRS and others in the past.

In addition to coding, I love to read about fitness, nutrition and epidemiology of cancer as a disease. I organize regular support group circles to help bring positive mental shift from consumption to contribution in the community. I'm also a beginner powerlifter.

Overall, I care about code, environment and people.
